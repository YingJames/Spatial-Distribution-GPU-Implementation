# Spatial-Distribution-GPU-Implementation
This project demonstrates the parallel computing with CUDA. The program calculates the distance of one point to every other point in a data set and distributes the distances in a histogram. It focuses on implementing a spatial distance histogram (SDH) algorithm using GPU acceleration.

One of the key features of this program is the demonstration between the time comparison of the CPU implementation and the GPU implementation. The GPU implementation will obviously be much faster, but it is still amazing to see just how fast it can be compared to the CPU timings.

This project was initially a project for my course in Parallel Computing, but I beleive it is still a great reference point for myself, and possibly others who want to see how effective parallel computing can be.
